HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN CUSTOM TATTOOS.

Think you can do a better job than the finest skin artists in Albion? Want to
customise your Hero down to his very flesh? Here's how to do it.

In the Tattoos folder (found in 'My Documents\My Games\Fable') you'll see a folder
named after your user profile. Inside you'll find a bitmap (.bmp file) for each of 
the tattoo types you can customise:

arms.bmp
back.bmp
chest.bmp
face.bmp
legs.bmp

Open the tattoo type you want to customise in an image editing program such as
Microsoft Paint. Once you have edited the image, save the result.

Next time you pay a visit to a Tattooist in the game, your customised tattoo will
be available for application in the same way as those found on Tattoo Cards.

Please note that customised tattoos will only become available in game once they
have been altered.

Should you ever need to revert back to the blank tattoo image, you will find the
originals in the 'Data\Tattoos' folder, which is in your Fable installation
folder. Simply copy the bitmap file over the custom tattoo you want to replace
(removing the "_base" part of the filename).
